    risks:
      'Trading foreign exchange (forex), cryptocurrencies, bonds, indices and commodities, on margin, carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all individuals. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange or other markets you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some, or all, of your initial investment. Therefore, you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. In some cases, it is possible to lose more than your initial investment as it is not always possible to exit a market at the price you intend upon doing so. There are also risks associated with utilising an Internet-based trade execution software application including, but not limited to, the failure of hardware and software. You should be aware of all the risks associated with investing in foreign exchange or other markets and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.',
